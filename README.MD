# Cruise Ships

This is a JavaScript exercise in object dependency and test-driven development, created as part of my studies with the Command Shift bootcamp.

## Installation

The project is designed to be run locally in the jest test suite. You will need the node project manager installed on your machine for this project to run. 

`npm install`

To clone the project to your machine, navigate to your desired directory in the terminal and run:

`git clone https://github.com/JordsCodes/cruise-ships`

To access the test suite, you will also need to install jest in the root directory of the project:

`npm install jest -d`

The tests can be accessed by running `npm test` in the root directory.

## Usage

The project simulates a cruise ship. In the src folder you will find js files for ship, itinerary and port. Port objects are instantiated and passed into Itinerary objects, and these Itinerary objects are passed into the Ship object.
